# did_change_authlocal

This is a plugin that allows data to be retrieved and compared when the user has a change in biometric data

## The First

The reason I develop the plugin is because I want to protect users when using Face ID (iOS) and Fingerprint (Android) security when I want to add a new layer of protection, which is Passcode. Bad guys can peek then will update their Face ID & Fingerprint and will perform bad actions. This is extremely dangerous with Financial Apps

## For exmaple

You need to watch the video to understand more about how it works
